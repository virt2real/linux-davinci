	  Say Y if you want to reset unused clocks during boot.
	  This option saves power, but assumes all drivers are
	  using the clock framework. Broken drivers that do not
	  yet use clock framework may not work with this option.
	  If you are booting from another operating system, you
	  probably do not want this option enabled until your
	  device drivers work properly.
